 **`1 window function 分类`**  

Aggregates:  COUNT, SUM, AVG 

Ranking:       RANK, DENSE_RANK, PERCENT_RANK, CUME_DIST, ROW_NUMBER 

Analytical:     NTILE, LEAD, LAG, NTH, FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE 

其中标红为额外需要buffer的window函数 

下面我们先看一下每个window function的执行情况，用于理解window function的使用场景：  **`1.1 Rank:`**  

SELECT name, department_id AS dept, salary, 

RANK() OVER w AS`rank`

FROM employee 

WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY department_id 

ORDER BY salary DESC);  


![][0]   **`1.2 Dense_rank`**  

SELECT name, department_id AS dept, salary, 

RANK() OVER w AS`rank`, DENSE_RANK() OVER w AS dense 

FROM employee 

WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY department_id 

ORDER BY salary DESC); 

![][1] **`1.3 Row_number`**  

SELECT name, department_id AS dept, salary, 

RANK() OVER w AS`rank`, DENSE_RANK() OVER w AS dense, 

ROW_NUMBER() OVER w AS`#`

FROM employee 

WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY department_id 

ORDER BY salary DESC); 

![][2]   **`1.4 cume_dist`**  

0< cume_dist () <=1 

SELECT name, department_id AS dept, salary, 

RANK() OVER w AS`rank`, DENSE_RANK() OVER w AS dense, 

ROW_NUMBER() OVER w AS`#`, CUME_DIST() OVER w AS cume 

FROM employee 

WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY department_id 

ORDER BY salary DESC); 

![][3] **`1.5 percent_rank`**   

0<= percent_rank () <=1 

SELECT name, department_id AS dept, salary, 

RANK() OVER w AS`rank`, DENSE_RANK() OVER w AS dense, 

ROW_NUMBER() OVER w AS`#`, CUME_DIST() OVER w AS cume, 

PERCENT_RANK() OVER w AS p_r 

FROM employee WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY department_id 

ORDER BY salary DESC); 

![][4] **`Note:cume_dist`**  computes the fraction of partition rows that are less than or equal to the current row and its peers, while **`percent_rank`**  computes the fraction of partition rows that are less than the current row, assuming the current row does not exist in the partition.   **`1.6 NTILE`**  

SELECT name, department_id AS dept, salary, 

… 

PERCENT_RANK() OVER w AS p_r, NTILE(3) OVER w AS`ntile`

FROM employee WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY department_id 

ORDER BY salary DESC); 

![][5]   **`1.7 LEAD`**  

SELECT name, department_id AS dept, salary, 

LEAD(salary, 1) OVER w AS`lead`

FROM employee 

WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY department_id 

ORDER BY salary DESC); 

![][6]   **`1.8 LAG`**  

SELECT name, department_id AS dept, salary, 

LAG(salary, 1) OVER w AS`lag`, 

LEAD(salary, 1) OVER w AS`lead`

FROM employee 

WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY department_id 

ORDER BY salary DESC); 

![][7]   **`1.9 FIRST_VALUE`**  

SELECT name, department_id AS dept, salary, 

SUM(salary) OVER w AS`sum`, 

FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER w AS`first`

FROM employee WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY department_id 

ORDER BY name 

ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) 

![][8]   **`1.10 LAST_VALUE`**  

SELECT name, department_id AS dept, salary, 

SUM(salary) OVER w AS`sum`, 

FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER w AS`first`, LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER w AS`last`

FROM employee WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY department_id 

ORDER BY name 

ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) 

![][9]   **`1.11 NTH_VALUE`**  

SELECT name, department_id AS dept, salary, 

SUM(salary) OVER w AS`sum`, 

NTH_VALUE(salary, 2) OVER w AS nth

FROM employee WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY department_id 

ORDER BY name 

ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)  


![][10]   **`2 Window function的解析:`**   **`2.1 Implicit and explicit windows`**  

Windows can be implicit and unnamed: 

COUNT( ) OVER (PARTITION BY DEPARTMENT_ID) 

 Windows can be defined and named via the windows clause clause: 

SELECT COUNT( ) OVER w FROM t 

WINDOW w as (PARTITION BY department_id)  **`2.2 window解析`**  

window function 按照用户的输入进行解析，window和window function是有一定的解析顺序和规则的。 

规则1 SELECT COUNT( ) OVER（w), mysql认为(w)为一个新的uname window, 新生成一个unnamed window, w是该unamed window的ancestor 

规则2 SELECT COUNT( ) OVER w,  SELECT sum( ) OVER w 会做为一个window的两个window function, 所以一个window可能有多个window function 

规则3 每个window都有自己唯一的position, 用于区分不同的window（有name和无name的），其生成序号的顺序是按照用户输入的window的顺序生成，但是执行顺序可能会不一样，有一定的优化 

规则4  SELECT COUNT( ) OVER (w order by a), WINDOW w as (PARTITION BY department_id), window可以定义一部分如partition by，继承后的window function可以定义自己的另一部分如order by, 但不允许两边同时定义相同的部分。 

规则5 window的SQL解析要避免嵌套依赖关系，如： 

  SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER w  FROM t1 WINDOW w AS (w2), w1 AS (w), w2 as (w1);  

w->w2 w1->w w2->w1 

  SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER w  FROM t1 WINDOW w AS (w); 

w->w

规则6 A window which depends on another cannot define partitioning. 

 select ROW_NUMBER() OVER (w1 partition by dept) AS ‘row_number’ from employee_salaries WINDOW w1 as (); 

规则7 继承关系的window不能存在多个order by定义 

mysql> explain select ROW_NUMBER() OVER (w1 order by dept) AS ‘row_number’ from employee_salaries WINDOW w1 as (order by salary desc); 

ERROR 3583 (HY000): Window ‘<unnamed window="">' cannot inherit 'w1' since both contain an ORDER BY clause.</unnamed>   **`2.3 window inheriting`**   **`继承关系表示一个window继承了另一个window的partition by和order by的信息，如：`**  

SELECT name, department_id, 

COUNT( ) OVER w1 AS cnt1, 

COUNT( ) over w2 AS cnt2 FROM employee 

WINDOW w1 AS (PARTITION BY department_id), 

w2 AS (w1 ORDER BY name) 

ORDER BY department_id, name; 

w2继承了w1的partition by department_id, 并且自定义自己的order by name.   **`2.4 window frame clause bound 定义`**  

![][11]   **`2.5 串行的执行流程`**   **`2.5.1 no need buffer`**  

![][12] **`2.5.2 need buffer`**   


![][13] **`3 PolarDB对window的支持`**  

目前PolarDB对window支持了并行，支持了多worker并行执行windows, 大大提升了window的查询性能。 

以TCPH Q2和Q17为例，100G的数据量，32个并行度情况下，Q2从原来的1.5秒左右提升到0.65秒左右，Q17从11.8秒左右到1.1秒左右.
